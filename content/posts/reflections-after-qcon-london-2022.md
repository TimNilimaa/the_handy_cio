This spring I attended my very first QCon conference. I've attended numorus conferences before, most of them hosted by Microsoft in one way or another. QCon was perhaps one of the first conferences I attended, at least for a decent amount of years, that had no affiliation to the software giant.

Here are my thoughts on some of the differnces.

# Why?

There are two whys to this post really. Why attend QCon and why write a post about it.
During a post(ish)-covid time, it wasn't clear to me that I wanted to attend a conference again. During covid there had been online-only conferences and to be honest, they were aweful. Truly aweful. The best thing that got produced from a online-only conference where the 'bible' of news that Microsoft used to present each day of their conferences. Then it was possible to skip the whole thing and simply read that paper and in case anything was unclear, what those re-runs.
