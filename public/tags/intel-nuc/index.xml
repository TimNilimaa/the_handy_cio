      <description>Executive summary For small environments or environments used for test and development, a few (relatively) cheap Intel NUCs together with one or two Synology NAS can be used for a High Availability Kubernetes cluster. This environment is not configured for production usage due to a couple of reasons such as no security configurations are done here nor is this tested with dual Synology NAS products - make sure to consult with an expert and/or use a hosted solution such as Azure, Google, AWS, Safespring or ELASTX.</description>
